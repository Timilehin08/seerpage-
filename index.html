    <p>We often times think that life is purely intellectual or sociological, depending on our different perspectives but Life measured based on all this is us not fully grasping the enirety of our lives. Life is spiritual. Most of the "random" happenings in our day are more than normal and not "just there" happenings.The ability to see heaven on earth at all point in times is absolutely needed in our daily lives. You'd be amazed at how we've entertained angels and had beyond normal happenings in our day to day activities without us knowing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is an unseen world right in our front of eyes.We may not see it because we do not look. </li>
      <li>There is a difference between seeing and looking. Seeing happens to a person; looking is the action the individual takes even before they see it. </li>

				<label>I'd like to assume you already know the following:</label>  
        <li> You've heard of the word, "seer" before. Probably in movies you've watched or stories you"ve read. </li>
        <li> You know that seers are also called Prophets or people who see into the future for people. </li>
        <li> There's a probability you've always taught all seers are mythical people and they probably just play with people's minds and it's all fake. </li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Who_is_a_seer?">
			<header>Who is a seer?</header>
			<div id="Whois"></div>
			<p>A seer is one sees, one who perceives and has visions. He is one who has an high accuracy in telling you the secrets of your heart,the things that no one else knew. His sight is beyond the natural into the invisible qualities of the heart. </p>
      <p> In the days of old, seers were an integral part of the society. Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Come, let us go to the seer",because the prophet of today used to be called a seer (You'd see this in 1 Samuel 9:9 in the HOLY BIBLE). </p>

			<p>Observe, first, dear friends, that before Jeremiah becomes a speaker for God, he must be a seer. The name for a prophet, in the olden time, was a "seer"-a man who could see with his mind's eye, one who could also see with spiritual sight, so as to vividly to realize the truth which he had to deliver the name of the Lord. Learn that simple lesson well, O you who try to speak for God! You must be seers before you can be speakers.                       ~"Lesson of The Almond Tree"
    </p>
    <pre><code>
			Putting this programmatically; we see, function SayIam(aSpeakerofGod) {
  					alert("Hello" + aSpeakerofGod);
				}
				greetMe("Aseer");
			</code></pre>
    <p> Which simply put means say I Am A Speaker of God when I am first A Seer.</p>

			<header>What Is The Importance Of Saying This?</header>
			<div id="WhatIs"></div>
			<p> This is important and useful to us as believers because it shows us how to walk in a seer lifestyle. We are not consumed by troubles because we see far beyond it. Our perspective, our mindset changes and we do not worry when things seem to go wrong for us. </p>  
    <p> We walk actively in faith and are not consumed bby physical sight seeing because there's a deep insight we have. an intuition that enables to live in the supernatural daily. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Secret_Things">
      <header>The Secret Things</header>
      <div id="TheSecret"></div>
      <p>You can categorise the secret things as:</p>
    <p>The Secret of the senses, The secret of stillness, The Secrets of words, The secret of Sound, amongst many others. </p> 
      <p> With the keyword var, for example, </p>
  <pre><code>
     var x = 1
     </pre></code>
     <p>This syntax is used to declare that knowing and understanding these secrets(x) equals you been 1 with God. </p>
      <code>
      x = 1
      </code>
        <p> Just as a man and a woman come together to become one, as husband and wife, so is anyone who understands the secrets of God. The variable is declarable as they become one with God. </p>
       <code>
         let y = 0
      </code>
      <p>This syntax declares that one who doesn't understand the secrets of God yet focuses on that which is ephemeral is zero i.e wasting.

    <section class="main-section" id="Secrets_Of_The_Seer">
      <header>Secrets Of The Seer</header>
      <div id="#Secrets"></div>
      <p>WALK IN A SEER LIFESTYLE where you can recognize the unseen world in everyday situations. RECOGNIZE SEER MOMENTS when the convergence between the natural and spiritual is occurring. DISCERN SUPERNATURAL ABUNDANCE by seeing what is often hidden in plain sight. MAKE SENSE OF PROPHETIC MYSTERIES such as entertaining angels, sanctified imagination, and bringing the invisible into the visible world. </p>
    <p> He stands at the door and knocks(see Rev 3:20). These practices and perspectives are ways to embrace the knocking in our life. He longs to speak us through dreams, visions, and third heaven encounters. He loves to show off Heaven to us. So then, "we seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God"(Col 3:1b) </p>
      <pre><code>
  if (true) {
  var x = 1
  }
  console.log(x); // 1
  </pre></code>
  <p> The above simply represents: x as sight equals 1 with God. </p>
  <p> This behaviour changes when we choose not to pay attention to the supernatural but focus on the ephemeral things which causes more trouble than good.</p>
  <pre><code>
  if (true) {
  let y = 0
  }
  console.log(y);
  //ReferenceError: y is not defined
  <p> As explained in the first, y represents man"s sight which would be left undefined in seeing. </p>
